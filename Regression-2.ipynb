    "Ans - Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage.

    "Ans - Dropout is a regularization technique that prevents neural networks from overfitting. Regularization methods like L1 and L2 reduce overfitting by modifying the cost function.

    "Ans - While regularized linear models offer significant advantages in mitigating overfitting and handling high-dimensional data, they also have certain limitations that can make them less suitable in some scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, regularization introduces bias into the model by shrinking coefficients, potentially leading to underfitting if the penalty is too strong. Secondly, the choice of regularization parameter (lambda) requires careful tuning, as an inappropriate value can negatively impact performance. Additionally, regularization techniques assume a linear relationship between predictors and the response, limiting their applicability to datasets with complex non-linear patterns. Furthermore, interpreting the coefficients in regularized models can be challenging due to their shrinkage, making them less suitable when clear understanding of feature importance is crucial. Lastly, regularization might not be the best choice when dealing with small datasets, as the focus should be on gathering more data rather than preventing overfitting. In such cases, simpler models might be more appropriate.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge offer powerful tools for handling overfitting and feature selection, they are not always the optimal solution for every regression problem. It's essential to consider the specific characteristics of your data, the complexity of the relationship between predictors and the response, and your modeling goals before deciding whether a regularized linear model is the best fit."
